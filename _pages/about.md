## Me
I am currently a master student studying Computer Science at [Columbia](https://cs.columbia.edu). I earned my Bachelor's degree in `Computer Science` and `Mathematics` at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).

I have broad interests on `Computer Science` and `Mathematics`. Particularly, I am interested in `software engineering`, `programming languages`, `formal verification`, and `software systems`. I am currently advised by Prof.[Ronghui Gu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rgu/), and work closely with Prof. [Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/). 

Aside from academics, I am interested in movies, food, musicals, and cooking.

If you wise to collaborate please contact me. Also, if you are undergrad or master students looking for research of programming languages, and verifications with me and my advisor, you may also contact me.
