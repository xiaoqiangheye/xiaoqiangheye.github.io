I am currently a master student studying Computer Science at [Columbia](https://cs.columbia.edu). I earned my Bachelor's degree in `Computer Science` and `Mathematics` at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).

I have broad interests on many aspects of `Computer Science` and `Mathematics`. Particularly, I am interested in `programming languages`, `formal verification`, `distributed system`, and `software systems`.
